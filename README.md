# CalorieTracker.me

Your personal health assistant to track, understand, and achieve your wellness goals.

## Background and Purpose

This application is designed as a personal health assistant. Its goal is to help you easily and intuitively understand and manage your nutritional intake and lifestyle. We believe that by tracking calories, macronutrients, and activities, you can make better decisions to achieve your health goals, whether it's losing weight, building muscle, or simply living a healthier life.

## Calculation Basis and Scientific Sources

Accuracy is key. The main calculation in this app, Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), is based on the Mifflin-St Jeor Equation. This equation is considered a gold standard for estimating Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and has been validated by numerous studies, including one published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association. The activity multipliers used to calculate TDEE from BMR are also based on long-standing standards in the field of nutrition, originating from studies by Harris & Benedict.
